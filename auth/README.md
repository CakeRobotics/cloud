# Cake Auth Service

This microservice provides an API for user authentication and management. A bearer token is issued upon calling the login endpoint. The token can later be used for authorization purposes.

See docs/openapi.yaml for API docs.

Possible roadmap:
- [ ] Refactor into `auth` and `users` services.
